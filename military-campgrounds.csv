First, the firearm may not be in a usable configuration; it must be unloaded and the chamber cleared.  It must also be in a locked container or compartment.  There are small gun safes available, which fulfill this requirement or you may lock it in the trunk of your vehicle. Second, ammunition must be separated from the firearm.  For example, if you choose to put the firearm in a small safe, the ammunition may not be in the safe, and if you choose to lock it in your trunk, the ammunition may not be in the trunk. Lastly, you must immediately declare the presence of the firearm to any law enforcement when stopped or questioned. Storing a firearm on the installation is also permissible.  Unless you reside in the dormitories, you may store the firearm in your vehicle, but the vehicle must be locked and the firearm must be out of sight.  If you reside in base housing, and store the firearm in your residence, you must register the firearm by filing an Air Force Form 1314, and a Department of Defense Form 2760 with the armory in Bldg. 20221. If you have a New Mexico concealed carry permit, it does not authorize you to conceal, or carry a firearm on the installation.

Westport is located 20 miles south of Aberdeen, WA, and 130 miles south of Seattle, WA. From Seattle: Take I-5 southbound towards Portland. Take the US-101 North exit (Exit 104) towards Aberdeen/Port Angeles. Merge onto US-101 N. Take WA-8 W towards Montesano/Aberdeen. WA-8 W becomes US-12 W. US-12 W becomes US 101 N. Upon arrival in Aberdeen, follow the directional signs to SR-105 South. At the Visitors Information Center before you reach the Westport town limits, the road splits (called the “Westport Y”).  The best route to the Coast Guard Station (to pick up the gate and restroom keys) is to turn right onto Montesano St. [SR105] and proceed toward Westport.  There is a tiny sign indicating a right turn toward the Coast Guard Station at Wilson, but the main landmark is the Chevron Station.  Turn right, go two blocks to Nyhus; turn right into fenced area and enter tan brick USCG Station building.  The OOD staff does not assign spots or give keys without notification from the USCG Seattle facility, nor do they accept payment for sites.  All arrangements are made through Seattle office. From the Station parking lot, make a U-turn and immediately turn left back onto Wilson.  At the Chevron Station (Montesano) proceed straight onto West Wilson, which soon becomes Forrest St.  Turn right at the 2nd stop sign onto Ocean Ave.  Drive to cut-out sign of a lighthouse on your right and turn right into narrow gravel lane.  There is no indication this is a campground.  Open chain or gate, drive in, staying to the left of the lighthouse and find your assigned spot.","","(206) 217-6129/6357/6359",,"PSSU Seattle MWR, 1519 Alaskan Way South, Seattle, WA 98134","https://www.dcms.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Human-Resources-CG-1/Community-Services-Command-CSC/MWR/Coast-Guard-Lodging/","Active Duty, National Guard, Reservists, Retired Military, 0-100% DAV, Purple Heart Recipients, Former POW, Veteran Caregivers, DoD Civilians.
